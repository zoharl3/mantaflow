- A grid is created in FluidSolver::getGridPointer(). 
    - A MAC seems to be allocated as a regular size grid. The data is kept in the centers, and the walls are interpolated, instead of the other way around.
- knMapLinearVec3ToMACGrid() has a kernel macro in the definition. This macro has a variadic param, and it's executed for every point.
- setInterpolMAC() interpolates MAC from particles. The four grid points are ref[0], ref[X], ref[Y], ref[X+Y].
