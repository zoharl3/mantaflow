- A grid is created in FluidSolver::getGridPointer(). 
    - A MAC seems to be allocated as a regular size grid. The data is kept in the centers, and the walls are interpolated, instead of the other way around.
- knMapLinearVec3ToMACGrid() has a kernel macro in the definition. This macro has a variadic param, and it's executed for every point.
- setInterpolMAC() interpolates MAC from particles. The four grid points are ref[0], ref[X], ref[Y], ref[X+Y]. 
- The output precision is set in Vector3D<S>::toString() in vectorbase.h.

- cmake
    - there's an option DEBUG_PYTHON_WITH_RELEASE for the linked lib
